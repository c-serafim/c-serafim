# 1. About Me ðŸ‘‹
Hi there! I'm CristÃ³vÃ£o Serafim, a Senior undergraduate student working towards my Econometrics & Applied Quantitative Economics Bachelor's @ Pace University ðŸ“š ðŸ’».

Born and raised in Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. Currently based in Brooklyn, New York. ðŸŒŽ

# 2. Interests ðŸ’­
I am interested in Economic Development, Technology, and Innovation, in particular, I want to study how public policy can impact technological advancement, and how corporations can benefit from developing relationships with Hard Tech Startups. 

Some of my hobbies are biking ðŸš², drawing, and photography. And my biggest challenge, currently, is understanding how to connect my passion for Creative Practices, and my aptitude for Technology and Data Science.

# 3. Projects ðŸ“–

- **Corruption, Democracy and Organized Crime**

    - Developed an original Econometric Model and Research Paper that involved explaining and forecasting Corruption Rates using 5 categorical variables (Organized Criminal Markets Index, Human Development Index, Political Regime Index, and the Number of Business days it takes to open a business - as a proxy for bureaucracy). - This project has led me to present my research at Academic Conferences and it was overall an amazing experience.

- **Startup Velocity** - *Venture Capital*

    - More recently, I've led the development of a tool that automatically parses and processes a large proprietary dataset of funding rounds and calculates critical metrics such as Startup Velocity, Time Between Deals, Average Check Size, etc.

I am just getting started with GitHub, but soon enough you'll be able to find the repositories for these projects in my profile.
