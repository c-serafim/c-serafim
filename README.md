- **What's In Your Wallet?** - *Economics Paper*

    - Built and analyzed a 29K-observation panel in Python from the Federal Reserveâ€™s Diary of Consumer Payment Choice

- **Corruption, Democracy and Organized Crime**

    - Developed an original Econometric Model and Research Paper that involved explaining and forecasting Corruption Rates using 5 categorical variables (Organized Criminal Markets Index, Human Development Index, Political Regime Index, and the Number of Business days it takes to open a business - as a proxy for bureaucracy). - This project has led me to present my research at Academic Conferences and it was overall an amazing experience.

    - More recently, I've led the development of a tool that automatically parses and processes a large proprietary dataset of funding rounds and calculates critical metrics such as Startup Velocity, Time Between Deals, Average Check Size, etc.
